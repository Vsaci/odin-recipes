    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>You just came back from your lovely trip to Southern Italy but you're feeling like something's missing in your house now. <br> <br> You may wonder, what though? <br><br> A fresh, hand-made pizza, of course! <br> <br> But fear not, my dear friend. Just read along this recipe and start making your own, maybe-ugly-but-delicious pizza! Like Italians say, "every cockroach is beautiful in their mother's eyes". <br> (Italians are weird but we love 'em anyways)

    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
        <li>...and many more I'm too lazy to list!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
        <li>I haven't listed all of the ingredients, do you really think I'm gonna list all of the steps?!</li>
