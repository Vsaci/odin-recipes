    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>350-400 g of flour</li>
        <li>1150 g of bacon</li>
        <li>700 g of mixed meat</li>
        <li>90 g of butter</li>
        <li>300 g of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>...and many more I'm too lazy to list!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
        <li>That's it!</li>
    </ol>
